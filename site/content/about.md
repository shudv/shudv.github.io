Since quite some time I have been maintaining a notebook with ideas that cross my mind.

<img src="/images/notebook.jpg" alt="notebook" style="width:100%"/>

These are ideas that are directly influenced by the miniscule amount of knowledge that I have and hence are, by all means, *trivial* in nature. Hence my only intention with this website is to put forward a (hopefully) unique perspective on topics that I am interested in. The topics can range from science to philosophy and religion.

If you find anything interesting here that you would like to discuss further, please drop an email to me by clicking the mail icon below.
